/**
  * This is an event sourced entity. It has a state, [[HelloState]], which
  * stores what the greeting should be (eg, "Hello").
  *
  * Event sourced entities are interacted with by sending them commands. This
  * entity supports two commands, a [[UseGreetingMessage]] command, which is
  * used to change the greeting, and a [[Hello]] command, which is a read
  * only command which returns a greeting to the name specified by the command.
  *
  * Commands get translated to events, and it's the events that get persisted by
  * the entity. Each event will have an event handler registered for it, and an
  * event handler simply applies an event to the current state. This will be done
  * when the event is first created, and it will also be done when the entity is
  * loaded from the database - each event will be replayed to recreate the state
  * of the entity.
  *
  * This entity defines one event, the [[GreetingMessageChanged]] event,
  * which is emitted when a [[UseGreetingMessage]] command is received.
